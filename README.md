# Description

Using the book Test-Driven Development with Python as a guide I plan to learn the development of a real web application from beginning to end. The online/hands-on guide will improve my understanding of test-driven development (TDD) in Python and its practical advantages. I will learn how to write and run tests prior to building each part of my app, and then develop the minimum amount of code required to pass those tests.
In the process, I’ll learn the basics of Django, Selenium, Git, jQuery, and Mock, along with current web development techniques.

  1. TDD workflow, including the unit test/code cycle and refactoring
  2. Use unit tests for classes and functions, and functional tests for user interactions within the browser
  3. I will learn when and how to use mock objects, and the pros and cons of isolated vs. integrated tests
  4. Test and automate my deployments with a staging server
  5. Apply tests to the third-party plugins I integrate into your site
  6. Run tests automatically by using a Continuous Integration environment
  7. Use TDD to build a REST API with a front-end Ajax interface
